# Canvas-Asteroids
Project that builds upon the orginal asteroid game.

• Collisions (so that the player can be killed when hitting an asteroid). The classic asteroids 
game did not have collisions between asteroids.

• Bullets so the player can shoot the asteroids. When shot, large asteroids split into small 
asteroids, while small ones are removed from play

• A scoring system and lives (the player gets 3 lives before the game is over)

• A visual explosion effect when the player is killed

• A levels system – so when all asteroids are destroyed, a new larger group of them is 
spawned

• Added alien spaceships which fly across the screen from time to time if the player is being slow 
completing a level. These spaceships shoot at the player as they cross the screen

• Arrow keys for movememnt and spacebar for shooting bullets.
